2)
Steps to run the precompiled version:
- Run the monopolyGame.exe located in ./compiled/MonopolyGame.exe
Steps to compile and run from the code:

a vs2019 with .net framework installed is needed.
(project can simply be loaded by the PA3UI.sln)
      
3)   Our UI design is satisfactory and functional and the strongest part of our project. The facade pattern with direct access to 
all the classes in the backend not being in our initial design meant that all the interactions the UI had with the backend had to be changed. 
This process created more bugs than we expected which translates to the weakest part of our assignment. 
From our understanding, we do not have anything missing from our assignment.
